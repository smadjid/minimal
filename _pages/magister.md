## Thesis
### PhD Thesis (University of Bejaia - Algeria, 2019)
Topic: Models and Tools for Usage based e-Learning Documents Reengineering 
Supervisor: Pr. Yannick Prié & Dr. Benoît Encelle

Providing high-quality content is of utmost importance to drive successful reading. Besides, designing documents that are received the way the author wishes has always been difficult, and the digital world increases this difficulty by multiplying the possibilities related to mixed medias and interactivity. This compels authors to continuously review the  delivered content to meet readers' needs. Yet it remains challenging for them to detect the comprehension barriers that may exist within their documents, and to identify how these latter can be improved accordingly. 

In this thesis, we focus on an educational context, where reading is a fundamental activity and the basis of many other learning activities.  We propose a learning analytics approach for assisting course authors to maintain their courses to sustain learning. The proposals are based on theoretical background originated from research on learning analytics, reading comprehension and content revision. We advocate ``usage-based document reengineering'', a process defined as a kind of reengineering that changes document content and structures based on the analysis of readers' usages as recorded in their reading traces.

  We model reading activity using the concept of reading-session and propose a new session identification method. Using  learners' reading sessions, a set of indicators related to different aspects of the reading process are computed and used to detect comprehension issues and to suggest corrective content revisions. The results of the analytics process are presented to authors through a dashboard empowered with assistive features.

We instantiate our proposals using the logs of a major European e-learning platform, and validate it through a series of studies. The results show the effectiveness of the approach and related dashboards to enhance authors awareness learners' needs, and to provide them with guidance in improving their courses accordingly.

## Magister Thesis (University of Bejaia - Algeria, 2011)
Topic: Models and Documentary Tools for Hypervideos on the Web  
Supervisor: Pr. Yannick Prié & Dr. Olivier Aubert
Defined as a specialization of hypermedia focusing on interactive video, hypervideo is an attractive technology that promises non-conventional and powerful features. It aims to bring more powerful capabilities for video-centric documents and to offer novel user experiences with more elaborated practices and advanced interaction alternatives.

Usually defined from a conventional hypermedia perspective, the underlying concepts and representations are too general to qualify hypervideos, preventing this kind of documents from being broadly investigated. The need for theoretical foundations for hypervideos motivates the present work. With the aim to provide a formal data model that considers hypervideo beyond the very general and conventional hypermedia ones, CHM - Component-based Hypervideo Model - is an attempt to theorize hypervideos by following the general principles of component-based modeling and annotation-driven document description.

The proposed model serves as a basis for a Web-oriented implementation used as a proof of principles and a means to provide a basis for more elaborated practices of online video implementation since the features of hypervideo are grafted to wider video-based Web documents in a simple yet powerful and Web standards-compliant manner.
