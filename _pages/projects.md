    title: 'LearningDataLab, 2023.'
    excerpt: "The Learning Data Lab (LDL) is an ongoing project aimed at leveraging learning analytics to enhance the quality of educational experiences. The LDL team works to build a comprehensive infrastructure for collecting, processing, and analyzing data from multiple sources, such as MOOC platforms and institutional learning management systems. Through this infrastructure, LDL aims to provide actionable insights to educators and students to help improve learning outcomes. The LDL project includes a research component focused on Predictive Learning Analytics (PLA), which leverages machine learning algorithms to predict student success and detect potential dropout risks. With a focus on PLA, the LDL team aims to develop and implement effective interventions to support struggling students and provide them with targeted support. Ultimately, the LDL project aims to provide educators and administrators with the tools they need to make informed decisions and support student success."

    title: 'CHM'
    excerpt: "The CHM (Component-based Hypervideo Model) project aims to revolutionize the way we interact with multimedia documents through hypervideo, a video-centric hypermedia that allows for immersive audiovisual experiences. By introducing a new data model that formally describes hypervideo documents and their behaviors, the CHM project will enable the design of more sophisticated and engaging multimedia experiences. The project has two main objectives: (1) To develop a comprehensive and formal model for hypervideo documents, extending beyond conventional multimedia and hypermedia models. (2) To create a practical framework that enables the design of web-oriented hypervideos, unlocking new possibilities for the use of multimedia in a variety of fields. With the CHM project, we are paving the way for a new era of multimedia interaction, bringing together cutting-edge technology and innovative design principles. CHM is a sub-project of the Advene Project. For details, please visit the project homepage: https://www.advene.org/chm/"
