## CHM/WebCHM, 2010
The CHM (Component-based Hypervideo Model) project aims to revolutionize the way we interact with multimedia documents through hypervideo, a video-centric hypermedia that allows for immersive audiovisual experiences. By introducing a new data model that formally describes hypervideo documents and their behaviors, the CHM project will enable the design of more sophisticated and engaging multimedia experiences. The project has two main objectives: (1) To develop a comprehensive and formal model for hypervideo documents, extending beyond conventional multimedia and hypermedia models. (2) To create a practical framework that enables the design of web-oriented hypervideos, unlocking new possibilities for the use of multimedia in a variety of fields. With the CHM project, we are paving the way for a new era of multimedia interaction, bringing together cutting-edge technology and innovative design principles. CHM is a sub-project of the Advene Project. For details, please visit the project homepage: https://www.advene.org/chm/
